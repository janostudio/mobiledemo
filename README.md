# An animation demo in Mobile

* **Please don't fork this project, this project is only for special people.**

This project is a animation demo in mobile, there display animation by `@keyframes`, and sync play audio as background-music.I used dragula js plugin for drag/drop in mobile for the HTML5 drag API can only be used in desktop browser.`@keyframes` can animate but won't change element's attributes, but transition will.And Transform is just a CSS attribute.

May I more understand *-router's principle, and JS program is really programed with es and API which is DOM BOM or nodejs.
